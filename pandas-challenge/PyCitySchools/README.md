# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Key Findings

- **School Budget vs. Performance**: Overall, schools with larger budgets did not achieve better test results. In contrast, schools with higher per-student spending actually underperformed compared to schools spending $585 per student.

- **School Size and Performance**: Generally, smaller and medium-sized schools significantly outperformed large schools in terms of passing math performance (89-91% passing vs. 67%).

- **Charter vs. District Schools**: Broadly speaking, charter schools outperformed public district schools across all metrics. However, further analysis will be required to determine if this effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.

## Data Overview

The dataset contains information about students and schools in the PyCity school district, including student ID, name, gender, grade, school name, reading and math scores, school type (district or charter), school size, and school budget.

## Code Execution

The code provided in the Jupyter Notebook `PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb` can be used to analyze the dataset and generate the key findings mentioned above. The notebook includes the following steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries and load the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Perform various data analysis tasks, such as calculating the passing rates for reading and math, grouping the data by school size and type, and comparing the performance of district and charter schools.
3. Generate insights and draw conclusions based on the analysis.

To run the code, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook and the necessary Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Numpy) installed. Once you have the environment set up, you can open the `PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb` file and execute the cells to see the analysis and results.
